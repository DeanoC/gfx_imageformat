TinyImageFormat

TinyImageFormat is a library implementing the common image pixel formats that are used in real-time graphics.
Whilst it provides a enumeration style image format, similar to Vulkan, D3D and Metal is also exposes many other useful information about each format. As well as information it provides functions to decode and encode most formats giving a single library capable of handling many image format you might encounter.

It currently supports image format with up to 4 channels. It has both logical (you ask for Red) or physical (you ask for Channel 0) functions. Most users will want to use logical channels, as it handles all swizzling and constants automatically. Channels are supported up to 64 bit integers and floating point (doubles). It is fixed at Little Endian only, as this is the only machines its currently built for.

It is available as a single header or as several smaller ones. The functionality is exactly the same its purely your own preference which to use. The files you include are generated by a custom code generator that takes a description of each format, generates a 64 bit descriptor code and then creates the header from that.

The multiple header version is split into several related sections, wheres the single header has them all together. The sections are
Base - basic enumerations and structure
Query - query infomation about a image format
Apis - helpers for the main real-time 3D libraries (Vulkan, D3D and metal)
Fetch - Functions to decode pixel data from an image format
Put - Functions to encode pixel data from an image format

All types and function are prefixed by TinyImageFormat_ or TIF_ as a form of namespaces, these will be left off for the API documentation.

The basic unit is the block, each image format has a 3D size that represents the smallest quantum of data you can work with. For basic image formats this is a 1x1x1 pixel block, meaning you can fetch and put single pixels of the image. However many other image formats have block larger than this. The DXBC formats are all 4x4x1 as thats the size of the compressed data. The smallest quantum you can fetch or put is a 4x4 pixel block.
Another common use of blocks is to pack non machine word aligned image format (like 1 bit per pixel images) and also pixel format with different frequency (I.e 4:2:0 video formats, that store channels at different rates).

The smallest unit the API uses is an 8 bit byte, smaller formats either have large block size or multiple channels are packed together to 8 or more bits.
E.g.
R4G4 is an 8 bit byte encoding 2 4 bit channels
R1 is an 8 bit byte encoding 8 pixels together (has a block of 8x1x1)
